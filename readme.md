# Relativistic Asteroids

This project is a clone of asteroids that I have created to learn a bit about special relativity. Lots of
the visualisations in this project are only approximately representative of what would actually happen, but I have
made sure that all of it is as physically accurate as possible.

I will be probably making a web version of this for my website soon.
